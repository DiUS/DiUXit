# DiUXit!

DiUXit is a proof of concept, based on the game named "Dixit", developed by the contributors of this github project to become familiar with websockets and to see if the digitization of boards games using a communal device (to act as a "table" or "game board") and individual player devices (to act as a player's "hand") is a viable and enjoyable experience.
